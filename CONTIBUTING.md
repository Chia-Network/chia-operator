All commits should be signed using a key attached to your GitHub profile before creating a PR. 

When creating a pull request, have a clear summary of what the change does and why the change is useful. As an example of an acceptable PR message:

```
This pull request adds support for Chia Wallets. This would be useful for writing 3rd party apps to be deployed to kubernetes that need to communicate to a Chia wallet's RPCs.
```

### API Contributions

These rules/guidelines are meant to help keep a well defined style for accomplishing controller logic, and in some cases also helps persist controller-gen/kubebuilder defaults in comment tags because it can be easy to accidentally override the API default with a type's zero value on accident, for example.

  1. Optional fields should always include omitempty as an option in the json tag. ex. `json:"image,omitempty"`
  2. Optional embedded struct fields, and sometimes string/bool/int fields, with no defaults should use pointers. A general rule of thumb is to consider how you want to handle the configuration logic surrounding that field in the controller code. If the field may not be configured commonly then it may be convenient to do a simple `if x == nil` check to keep it blank in the resulting K8s Kind struct. Optional embedded struct fields are especially convenient to just check against nil.
  3. A required field should usually specify a default, and that default should usually try to match a default configuration from chia-blockchain, or one that is especially advantageous to running in kubernetes. Some required fields don't need defaults, like the one for a chia mnemonic.
  4. Fields that are autogenerated by kubebuilder should be left as-is and these rules do not apply to them.
